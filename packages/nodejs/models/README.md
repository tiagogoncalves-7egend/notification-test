# Notification Hub (Models)

This repository contains all models that should be honored by all _Notification Hub_ components. Specifically, it defines the target platforms that can receive notifications, as well as the notification's content.

This repository contains no application code. It only contais the type definitions for the _Notification Hub_ microservice.

## Available Target Platforms

There are two targets were you can publish notifications to: _Azure DevOps_ and _Slack_. Check the following examples to choose the payload that is most suitable to your needs:

### Azure DevOps

Write the notification as a comment in an _Azure Devops Work Item_:

```json
{
  "type": "azure-work-item",
  "workItem": {
    "id": 1,
    "project": "project-name"
  }
}
```

### Slack

Post the notification as a message in a _Slack_ channel:

```json
{
  "type": "slack-channel",
  "channel": "tests"
}
```

Send the notification as a _Direct Message_ (_DM_) to all members in a _Slack_ channel:

```json
{
  "type": "slack-channel-members",
  "channel": "tests"
}
```

Send the notification as a _Direct Message_ (_DM_) to a single _Slack_ member:

```json
{
  "type": "slack-member-email",
  "email": "tests@7egend.cr"
}
```

Send the notification as a _Direct Message_ (_DM_) to a list of _Slack_ members:

```json
{
  "type": "slack-members-email",
  "emails": [
    "tests+1@7egend.cr",
    "tests+2@7egend.cr",
    "tests+3@7egend.cr",
    "tests+4@7egend.cr"
  ]
}
```

> NOTE: This target will send a message directly to each user. It won't create a group conversation.

## Supported Notifications

Each notification is associated with a specific event. When posting notifications, each of those notifications will be renderered differently and based on the context of the target platform. Check the [runner](https://gitlab.com/7egend/projects/home/microservices/notification-hub/server/runner) repository for more info.
